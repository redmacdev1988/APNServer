<h3>Sending Custom Notifications</h3>

UPDATED 3/3/2016:

New version conforms to project's need much better. Basically, for whatever notification you want to send, you have to build it by copy and pasting in data.

You copy and paste ALERT and PAYLOAD info into the textfields from sample text. Pay attention to some requirement details such as dates.

Then you simply press the send button, and your iOS app will receive the notification. If you are working with the Apple Watch, make sure you sleep the iPhone as well as your watch.
